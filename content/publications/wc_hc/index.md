**Abstract** 


<p align="justify"> 
Standard urban economics models tell us that wages, through agglomeration economies effects, are higher in large cities, but that the concentration of economic agents in these large cities increases housing prices. In equilibrium, wages should compensate for differences in housing costs across space, real wages should be equated across cities of different sizes and workers should be perfectly mobile.
When considering heterogeneous agents (high-skilled, low-skilled), these models imply that, due to a higher housing cost burden for the low-skilled, the latter should be, compared to the high-skilled, relatively more compensated in expensive areas. In other words, low-skilled wages should increase more than high-skilled wages in cities with higher housing costs. 
I however observe, through French data on wages and housing costs, that this compensation mechanism does not seem to work anymore in the recent period.  This article firstly aims at measuring robustly the level of these wage compensations and their evolution over time, and secondly at underlining the factors that may explain a lower compensation for the low-skilled. 
Two sets of explanations are considered. First, the existence of agglomeration economies forces that would benefit more high-skilled workers than low-skilled workers in costly cities. Second, the existence of frictions that would explain why low-skilled are at equilibrium less compensated for higher housing costs. 
Labor market frictions in costly cities could be more detrimental to low-skilled workers. The latter may have less bargaining power than high-skilled in these cities, due to (i) their higher local unemployment rate, and (ii) to local labor markets featuring more monopsony for them. 
Mobility frictions may also be greater in costly cities for the low-skilled: (i) who are more dependent on their local networks; (ii) for whom finding employment in less expensive and remote cities is more difficult; (iii) who may suffer more from rigidities on the housing market ("locked-in effect" linked to social housing).
