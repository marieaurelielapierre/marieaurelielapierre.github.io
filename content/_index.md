Welcome to my website! I am Marie Aurélie Lapierre, a PhD candidate at Université Lumière Lyon 2 and <a href="https://www.gate.cnrs.fr/en/">GATE-LSE</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.gate.cnrs.fr/en/florence-goffette-nagot/">Florence Goffette-Nagot</a>. I am also a Temporary Lecturer at CY Cergy Paris Université and <a href="https://thema.u-cergy.fr/">Thema</a>.

<p align="justify"> 
As an applied economist in urban and labor economics, I am interested in understanding and exploring the inequalities that arise from the interaction of these two fields. My on-going research projects focus on neighborhood effects in job search behaviors, wage compensation for housing costs, and the role of unaffordable housing in shaping labor market trajectory disparities.
