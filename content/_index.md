Welcome to my website! I am Marie Aurélie Lapierre. I have just defended my PhD in Economics at Université Lumière Lyon 2 and <a href="https://www.gate.cnrs.fr/en/">GATE-LSE</a>, where I was supervised by <a href="https://economie.ens-lyon.fr/en/about-us/our-people/florence-goffette-nagot">Florence Goffette-Nagot</a>. I am also a Temporary Lecturer at CY Cergy Paris Université and <a href="https://thema.u-cergy.fr/">THEMA</a>.

As an applied economist in urban and labor economics, I am interested in understanding and exploring the inequalities that arise from the interaction of these two fields. My on-going research projects focus on neighborhood effects in job search behaviors, wage compensation for housing costs, and the role of unaffordable housing in shaping labor market trajectory disparities.
