We provide empirical evidence of the influence of housing costs on labor market disparities between high-skilled and low-skilled workers in French urban areas during the period 2010-2018. We focus on two labor market outcomes: the likelihood of having a long-term employment contract and job promotions. We use French administrative data to follow the labor market trajectories of workers as well as precise data on housing costs. We implement a between-city analysis along with a ''two-stage approach'' to control for the non-random spatial sorting of individuals across cities. We also use instrumental variable techniques to deal with the endogeneity between the housing and labor markets. Our findings reveal that higher housing prices increase labor market disparities between skills regarding the probability of holding a long-term employment contract. \n These disparities are more pronounced for workers aged 35 or above and seem to be especially driven by low-skilled women. \n We do not find any significant influence on job promotion.\n\n","id":"https://marieaurelielapierre.github.io/publications/hc-lm/","title":"The impact of housing costs on labor market trajectories"},"https://marieaurelielapierre.github.io/publications/ne-js/":{"body":"Abstract \n \nThis paper aims to test for the influence of interactions with neighbors on job search behaviors of unemployed individuals. Using data from the 2014-2019 French Labor Force Survey, we implement a model of endogenous, contextual and group effects inspired from Manski (1993) and applied to job search intensity for different channels. \nWe control for location endogeneity in a similar way as in Bayer et al. (2008) and tackle the reflection issue by using the approach proposed by Lee (2007) and developed by Boucher et al. (2014). \nWe find evidence of endogenous peer effects for all the job search channels, which indicates the existence of imitation or spread of information effects, particularly for job search through personal and professional networks. \nWe also find some contextual and group effects with regards to neighbors’ occupations.  \nSuch results underline the importance for job search of being surrounded by neighbors with strong labor market connections, and suggest that local social interaction effects in job search could amplify labor market inequalities across neighborhoods.\n\n","id":"https://marieaurelielapierre.github.io/publications/ne-js/","title":"Neighborhood effects in Job search behaviors"},"https://marieaurelielapierre.github.io/publications/wc-hc/":{"body":"Abstract \n \nThis paper focuses on the question of wage compensation for housing costs. When housing costs rise with city size, wages should do the same for this gap to be sustainable.  Yet, the relationship is not so simple, and may vary across skills. The objective is thus to provide a robust measure of the relative compensation for housing costs between\nskill levels across cities, and its evolution over 2012-2020, in France. A specific method is proposed to build a composite housing cost index comprising the three segments of the French housing market. Recent developments in the urban wage premia literature are also used to build local skill wage indexes. The results outline two distinct periods: (i) a first 2012-2015 period in which both skill levels receive similar compensation; (ii) a second period, from 2016 onward, in which housing costs rise and high-skilled are more compensated.  This study thus contributes to a better understanding of the affordable housing issue in France by shedding light on a specific dimension: the unequal compensation for housing costs across skill levels.\n\n","id":"https://marieaurelielapierre.github.io/publications/wc-hc/","title":"Wage compensation for housing costs: are skilled and unskilled workers equal?"},"https://marieaurelielapierre.github.io/teaching/":{"body":"Teaching Assistant Activities🔗\n \nDuring my PhD journey, I have been a teaching assistant (chargée de travaux dirigés) at both Université Lumière Lyon 2 and CY Cergy Paris Université. \n\n","id":"https://marieaurelielapierre.github.io/teaching/","title":"Teaching"},"https://marieaurelielapierre.github.io/teaching/dynamic-macroeconomics/":{"body":"Details on the course\n\nLong-run macroeconomics.
